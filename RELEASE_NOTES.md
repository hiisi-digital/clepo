# clepo v0.2.1: Polish

This is a small patch release that completes the Phase 1 architectural refactor.

## Changes

- **Project Structure**: Renamed `app.ts` to `cli.ts` to better reflect its
  purpose as the main entry point for the `Cli` class. This was the final
  planned task for the v0.2 milestone.
